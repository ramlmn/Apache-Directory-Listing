# Apache-Directory-Listing
'Apache Directory Listing' is a theme inspired from [Apaxy](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/Apaxy) which uses Apache's `mod_autoindex` module.  

# Usage
* Download or clone the repo and copy all the files of `directory-listing` folder to any folder in the server(root directory is highly preferred).
* Copy the `.htaccess` file to the root directory of your server.
* Open the `.htaccess` file and
  * Replace `{SOME_FOLDER}` to the location of `directory-listing` folder on your server.
  * Finally replace `{VIEW}` to either `grid` or `table`.

# Themes
The theme is included with two css files for grid(`grid.css`) and normal(`table.css`) for table styled indexing.

Just change the `{VIEW}` in `.htaccess` to either `grid` or `table`.

You can add your custom code in the `header.html` and `footer.html`.
